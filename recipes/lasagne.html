        <li>24 oz marinara sauce</li>
        <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>

        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagne noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent. Stir in the marinara sauce and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and egg. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of lasagne noodles on top. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagne cool for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves.</li>
